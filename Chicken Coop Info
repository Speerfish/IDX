The blueprint for Cluckingham Palace was purchased from www.TheGardenCoop.com in 2013. 
The window and flower box were customized add ons. As was the reinforced main door for 
the coop to prevent drafts and retain heat in the winter. The garden pavers & cinderblocks 
were used to level the coop in a sloped yard.

The plans came with a full list of materials and took a weekend to construct. 
The materials were a 1 trip delivery from Home Depot.

Measure twice. Cut once.
